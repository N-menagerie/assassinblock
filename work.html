    <h1></h1>
    <p>Right now, I am a GIS intern at an engineering consultation firm called <a href="https://davidsengineering.com/">Davids Engineering</a></p>
        
    <p>In my day-to-day work, I am using Python scripts to clean, organize, and make sense of geospatial data. The data comes from water districts all over the central valley. Much of my work is related to the expansion of water-measurement devices in Glen-Colusa. I've generated turnout id's for over 5,000 turnouts in the Glen-Colusa Irrigation District (GCID) and related thousands of other data points for uploading into a centralized database. When I am done, GCID will be more equipped to track the movement of water through their system of canals and laterals.</p>
    <p>My internship was set to end this month. However, the team decided to keep me on through the end of the year!</p>
    <p>This has been an incredibly rewarding experience.</p>
