    <h1>Nathan's Personal Site: My Work</h1>
    
    <p>I'm a student at UC Davis closing in on a bachelor's of science while minoring in GIS. I am studying Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems</p>

    <p>This summer of 2024, I am a GIS intern at an engineering consultation firm called <a href="https://davidsengineering.com/">Davids Engineering</a></p>
        
    <p>In my day-to-day work, I am using Python scripts to clean, organize, and form relationships between geospatial data. The data comes from water districts all over the central valley.</p> 
        
    <p>Much of my work is related to the expansion of water-measurement devices in Glen-Colusa. I've generated turnout id's for over 5,000 turnouts in the Glen-Colusa Irrigation District (GCID) and related thousands of other data points for uploading into a centralized database. When I am done, GCID will be more equipped to track the movement of water through their system of canals and laterals.</p>

    <p>My internship was set to end this month. However, the team decided to keep me on through the end of the year!<br>This has been an incredibly rewarding experience.</p>
